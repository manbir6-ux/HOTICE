**Verification note:** The first GitHub Actions run on the initial Flutter UI commit reported failure without job logs being available through the connector. Code is committed but analysis and widget tests are **not yet verified passing**. Track root cause in M1.

This checklist tracks source-level implementation separately from integration and release verification. A checked box means the specified source/UI task was written, **not** that it is production-ready.

## M1 — UI foundation
- [x] Flutter dependency manifest and app entry.
- [x] HOTICE branding, premium reusable design system and responsive shell.

## Issue-based progress
Use GitHub Issues as separate task threads for each next phase; link commits/PRs to the issue, and close only once tested. Do not calculate a whole-project percentage from this checklist: the scope and weights are not fixed.
